## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

Hi, I’m **Zhuang (庄)**, a backend engineer with 8 years of experience. I have worked on designing many high-concurrency systems.

Starting from 2024, I've decided to focus my energy on learning frontend technologies. I’m also A photography, fitness, and English learner.

My Primary Programming Languages: **Java, Go, Lua, JavaScript, Node.js**

## Why I’m Writing

I admit that I’ve taken many detours in my learning process, but I will keep pushing forward. Perhaps someday I will achieve some milestones in my journey.

I hope my blog can provide some help to readers.
